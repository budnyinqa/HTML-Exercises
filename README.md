# HTML - Exercises
This repository documents the process of learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript during my university studies.

## Operations on Variables - Exercise 1
This project is a simple, interactive calculator-like web app that performs basic aggregate operations on values entered by the user. Its main purpose was to practice working with variables and functions in a real-world scenario.

The goal of this exercise was not just to build a calculator, but to deepen my understanding of how user input is processed and used in calculations, while reinforcing front-end development fundamentals.

## WCAG - Exercise 2
This is one of the simplest websites I created during my studies — but also one of the most informative when it comes to accessibility. While the page contains only a single image, a heading, and a short description, the focus of the exercise was on applying WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) best practices.

Despite the minimalist layout, I learned a lot about:

- structuring content semantically using proper HTML elements,
- assigning descriptive alt text to images to ensure screen reader compatibility,
- using logically ordered headings to provide a clear content hierarchy,
- ensuring good contrast ratios for readability,
- making the site navigable and understandable for people using assistive technologies.

## Calculator - Exercise 3
The goal of this project was to create a functional calculator that not only looks clean and responsive, but also performs common arithmetic operations with proper error handling and accessibility. While my first exercise focused on basic variable handling and simple operations, this project brings it all together into a fully interactive and visually polished web calculator.

Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of:
- DOM manipulation – selecting elements like the display and attaching events to buttons
- UI/UX improvements – shortening long results to fit the screen with slice() and adding visual consistency with CSS variables

The calculator logic is powered by a set of custom JavaScript functions. Here's a breakdown:
```html
appendToDisplay(input);  // Adds number or symbol to the display
clearDisplay();          // Clears the entire input
calculate();             // Evaluates the expression using eval(), with safety checks
percentage();            // Converts input value to its percentage
squareRoot();            // Calculates square root if input is valid and non-negative
deleteLast();            // Removes last character (like backspace)
```
Each function includes basic validation, and the UI automatically prevents layout overflow for long results. The calculator also gracefully handles mathematical edge cases like division by zero or square roots of negative numbers.
