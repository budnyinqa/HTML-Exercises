# HTML - Exercises
This repository documents the process of learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript during my university studies.

## Operations on Variables - Exercise 1
This project is a simple, interactive calculator-like web app that performs basic aggregate operations on values entered by the user. Its main purpose was to practice working with variables and functions in a real-world scenario.

The goal of this exercise was not just to build a calculator, but to deepen my understanding of how user input is processed and used in calculations, while reinforcing front-end development fundamentals.

## WCAG - Exercise 2
This is one of the simplest websites I created during my studies â€” but also one of the most informative when it comes to accessibility. While the page contains only a single image, a heading, and a short description, the focus of the exercise was on applying WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) best practices.

Despite the minimalist layout, I learned a lot about:

- structuring content semantically using proper HTML elements,
- assigning descriptive alt text to images to ensure screen reader compatibility,
- using logically ordered headings to provide a clear content hierarchy,
- ensuring good contrast ratios for readability,
- making the site navigable and understandable for people using assistive technologies.
